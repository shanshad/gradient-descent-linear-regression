# Gradient Descent Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the implementation of **batch gradient descent** to solve a **linear regression problem** with multiple features.

## Features
- Multiple features (5 in this example)
- Computes predictions using matrix multiplication
- Computes cost function (Mean Squared Error / 2m)
- Iteratively updates parameters using gradient descent
- Tracks and plots cost vs iterations
- Designed for educational purposes

## Note
Feature scaling has **not been applied** in this example. This is intentional for simplicity and demonstration purposes. In real applications, feature scaling can improve convergence speed.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/gradient-descent-linear-regression.git
